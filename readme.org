* Embedded Architecture Reference
Embedded Architecture Reference (EAR) is a library for IoT project. It is based on task scheduling approach.

* IO Operations
** Controller
IO Controller comprises of basic IO functions such as open,, close, read and write. The developer is supposed
to develop own IO controller such as serial, Ethernet or another one extending Controller class. It is not used
independently, it should be set to Device as device controller, and the device is owner of the controller. Thus,
you should use device for IO operation that you want to perform.

** Device
Device is another IO module located under IO namespace. It is first contact point of developer who wants to perform
IO operation. Each device has one unique IO controller, and responsible for managing it.
